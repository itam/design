                <h4 class="text-center">How to Set Up Files (Raster Tutorial)</h4>

                <h2>Step 1: Download the Templates</h2>
                <p>Download the template from our templates section. Open the template in photoshop, you'll see that it has many premade groups and layers. Depending on the type of charm and upgrades you selected, some of the groups will not apply to you. For wood and white acrylic, you will not be using the back group, you can go ahead and delete that group at this time. If you ordered wood charm or clear acrylic without gloss upgrade, you can delete the gloss group right now as well.</p>
                <img class="block-center" src="images/tutorial/step_1.jpg">

                <h2>Step 2: Add Your Artwork</h2>
                <p>Open the file with your artwork on it. If it has both front and back, make sure you select both layers. With the move tool selected, drag the image(s) onto the template.</p>
                <img class="block-center" src="images/tutorial/step_2.jpg">

                <h2>Step 3: Layer Setup</h2>
                <p>You'll now have your artwork in the template. Adjust the size to make sure it fits in the template if it's too big or small. For clear acrylic with double side: make sure you have both layers selected when you adjust the size to keep the layers lined up. Next you can drag the layers into the corresponding group. For a basic cut hole setup, move the cut hole to the desired spot. The solid line is where it will be cut. The dashed line will give you an idea how much space to leave between the cutline and the cut hole. For more advanced cuthole setup tips, check the <a href="#faqs-cuthole">FAQs</a>.</p>
                <img class="block-center" src="images/tutorial/step_3.jpg">

                <h2>Step 4: White Layer (Skip this step if you are printing white acrylic charms)</h2>
                <p>Right click your image in the layers > select pixel. Make a new layer in the white group, and fill the selection with black. Whatever is filled with black on this layer will be printed as white. If you'd like a translucent effect on some part of the charm, you can leave that part blank. I have filled the whole image with black because I want a complete white layer between my front and back image. If you are interested in translucent effect, please check the <a href="#faqs-translucent">FAQs</a>.</p>
                <img class="block-center" src="images/tutorial/step_4.jpg">

                <h2>Step 5: Gloss Layer (Skip this step if you are making wood charms or clear acrylics with no gloss upgrade)</h2>
                <p>White acrylic will have hi-gloss as a default, you will need to do this step if printing white acrylic charms. Make a new layer in the gloss group and fill it with black. Same as the last step, the black area will be printed with gloss. If you want spot gloss effect then only put black on the area you want the gloss.</p>

                <p class="text-center">Special note for acrylic charms:</p>
                <img class="block-center" src="images/tutorial/step_8.jpg">
                <p>Remember when printing on clear acrylic, the front image will come out flipped when printed. So please make sure your image is facing the right way. (The back image will print like your see on the monitor) In the picture above, I wanted the letters to print correctly, so I flipped the canvas horizontally. This way when the charm is printed, the letters will be in the right orientation. If your front and back image is different, you will need to have extra white upgrade. During set up, make sure your front and back layers are perfectly lined up. You can check this by lowering the opacity on the back layer. (Don't forget to return the opacity back to 100% after you finished checking your images!)</p>

                <h2>Step 6: How to Make the Cut Line</h2>
                <p>Now that you have all the layers set up, you will need to make a cutline. For a basic outline:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the artwork in the front layer</li>
                    <li>Right click on the thumbnail of your artwork and choose "Select Pixels"</li>
                    <li>Go to Select > Modify > Expand and expand by at least 20 pixels.</li>
                    <li>Delete any small cuts within the charm by using the Lasso Tool and shift+click to lasso around the unwanted cut lines</li>
                    <li>Go to Select > Modify > Smooth and smooth by at least 5 pixels</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Don't worry about the selection not conforming to the cuthole, we'll take care of that.</p>
                <p>Once you are done with these steps, you should have something that looks like the image below. Right click on the selection > Make work path (Make sure you have the Rectangular Marquee Tool or the Lasso Tool selected.)

                <h2>Step 7: Save Your Work Path</h2>
                <p>Click on the path tab, double click on the work path you just made and rename it "cut". Save the file and name it with the format: Order#_TotalQuantityOrdered_Type_Size_Design.psd (Order# provided in the confirmation email) - For example: <em>Order45_Q500_Wood_1Point5Inch_1of25.psd</em></p>

                <h2 id="faqs-cutline">Cutline</h2>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>Can I make my cutline smaller than 20 pixels? (i.e. I want it right on the border of the image)</h4>

                    <p class="answer">For acrylic charms, no. We require the cutline have at least a 20 pixel (Approximately 0.05") offset from your design. The reason for this requirement is because our charms are directly printed on acrylic and laser cut into the shape that you designed. As a result, the melting acrylic can potentially warp and/or weaken the printed area. So if you send us a file with a cutline of less than 20 pixels we will let you know and ask you to fix the file.</p>
                    <p>For wood charms, there is no minimum for the cutline. However, you will have to provide at least 16 pixels (Approximately 0.04") for bleed in your design. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>Can I make the cutline bigger than 20 pixels?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">Yes! You can modify the cutlines to anything you want as long as you retain at least 20 pixels border to the print area and keep it within the canvas size.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>Can I leave cuts within my charm so that there are holes in my charm besides the initial cuthole I assigned from the template?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">Yes! As long as the cutline within the charm has at least a 20 pixel border with the printed image. Also, you have to consider the shape of what you are cutting out and that the acrylic is being cut out by a laser so it will melt and not produce a clean cut if you are trying to cut out tiny strips (basically anything less than 20 pixels). In general, if you want to cut little parts out of the charm it does not look very good, but you can definitely incorporate larger holes that compliment your design and create really cool effects.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you make a donut charm you can cut out the donut hole in the middle as long as the hole is bigger than 20 pixels AND the cut is 20 pixels away from the printed donut. So the end product would be a printed donut on a donut shaped acrylic.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="faqs-cuthole">Cuthole</h2>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>Can I change the size of the provided cuthole in the template?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">You can expand the dashed line so that the cuthole will be deeper in the charm, but keep in mind that you will have to thread the charm so depending on the ring you plan on using it might be extremely difficult or impossible to thread. You cannot shrink the dashed line since it will make the cuthole too thin making the charm prone to shattering. Do not change the solid circle.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>Can I have multiple cutholes?</h4>
                    <p class="answer">Yes, you can have a maximum of 2 cutholes. Just duplicate the cuthole layer provided in the template and place the two cutholes where you want it to be. If you want more than two cutholes, there is an additional fee and you will need to <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="faqs-translucent">Translucent Effect</h2>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>What is charm translucency?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">The translucent effect can only work on clear acrylic charms if you leave out the white portion so that light passes through. The effect is similar to a stained glass look and works since the color inks are not completely opaque. However, in general darker, more saturated colors will come out looking better for this effect. For example, light yellow will barely show up while a darker, saturated blue can be clearly seen.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>So as long as I leave the white layer blank for a portion of my design, that part will come out translucent?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">For every color EXCEPT white, yes. Since printing white is entirely dependent on filling in the white layer, if you leave white in any translucent effect it will come out transparent instead.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>So is it possible to have translucent white?</h4>
                    <p class="answer">Yes, but you have to fill in that specific portion of white you want to be translucent with a lower opacity black in the white layer. Please let us know that this is an intended effect when you submit your order.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="faqs-upgrade">Upgrades</h2>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>How does it look like for wood charms with white and without?</h4>
                    <p class="answer">Here's a photo for you to compare wood charms printed with white and without:</p>
                    <div class="question-image"><img src="images/wood_compare.jpg"></div>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>When should I get the extra white upgrade?</h4>
                    <p class="answer">The extra white upgrade is only for clear acrylic charms. In general you would always want extra white if your front and back images are different. The reason is that the white ink is not 100% opaque and the color ink is translucent. As a result, a thick white layer in the middle of the front and back side acts as a divider minimizing how much you can see the back side of the charm from the front and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>However, even when the images are the same, you might consider using extra white if you want to minimize color variations. The issue is that with one layer of white, more light can pass through the charm so the colors seem more saturated since you can see through more to the identical back side from the front thus adding extra color to the same spots producing a darker effect. This issue will also produce greater inconsistancies between prints (i.e. printing the same image today then a month from now) since it will amplify any differences in printing caused by the environment (temperature, humidity, etc) and the amount of white ink left in the printer (which affects the opacity of the white ink). Unfortunately, these variations are part of the limitations of printing, but they can be mostly mitigated with the extra white upgrade. That being said, the color inconsistencies are not very apparent. Practically, you can only tell if you closely analyze the charms side by side or if you have stared at the original image for hours on end (i.e. the artist).</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h4>What's the difference between Matte Gloss and High Gloss?</h4>
                    <p class="answer">Matte Gloss has a shimmering look with a slightly textured feeling which is resistant to fingerprints. High Gloss has a thicker coating that gives a smoother, shiny look.</p>

                    <h4>Is there tax on my order?</h4>

                    <p class="answer">Only for our clients based in California. Unfortunately, we are required to collect sales tax for California based clients.</p>
                    <p>However, if you plan to resell our charms you can acquire a resale certificate then we do not have to collect sales tax for the order from you. You just need to have an active seller's permit during the purchase of the charms and meet a few basic criteria. Follow these links for more information:</p>
