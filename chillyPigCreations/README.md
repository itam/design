##### The Goal
This project got started when I first approached the owner of ChillyPig Creations asking if I could design a new page for them to use. I wanted to practice coding a site from scratch and I picked ChillyPig Creations since they are a small company and they don't have the resources to create and maintain a complicated web presence. I wasn't looking to re-invent the system they already had so painstakingly worked on, I just wanted to be able to give them a mobile-friendly, easy to navigate site.

4. Tried to keep most of the information the same.
5. Made sure than the page was mobile-friendly with the use of responsive design and media queries.

##### Deliberate Decisions:
1. Kept this site a single page HTML page for maintenance by owner purposes.
2. PayPal button image placeholder instead of actual PayPal code.
3. Store image placeholder instead of store snippet.
4. Contact form image placeholder instead of contact snippet.
5. Template download links don't actually lead to a file.
6. Use of `!important` (yuck) in CSS. Needed to be able to override third party css without having access to widget settings.

##### The Ideal
I would have loved to be able to create a React-based site with multiple pages and templating, but ultimately I believe that UX for the owner is just as important as UX for the end user. Although the HTML is argueably long and messy, it is easier to understand and search through than a traditionally structured enterprise web project and will be easier to change in the future.
