# Design Projects
Design related personal projects that I'ved worked on. All wireframes, HTML, CSS, and JS (aside from any libraries used) are done by me.

## [Account Settings](/accountSettings)
A re-imagination of the existing account settings page on http://smugmug.com. A PDF of wireframes for the new look and a folder of screenshots of existing UI.

## [Chilly Pig Creations - In Progress](/chillyPigCreations)
A hand-coded design for http://chillypigcreations.com

##### What I try to keep in mind:
1. This is a one page site designed with the consideration that the owners are not web stack saavy and I tried to keep it simple so the owners would be able to update it.
2. I kept their ordering system the same so they would not have the overhead of changing systems.
3. I wanted to have consideration given to ease of use for users and general UI/UX practices.
4. I wanted to have consideration for the structuring of information.
5. Tried to keep most of the information the same.

##### What needs to be worked on:
1. PayPal button image needs to be replaced with real code.
2. Actual links to services and order flow need to be added.
3. Contact form code needs to be added.
4. Transitions (WBN)
