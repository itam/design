# Personal Projects
Personal projects that I'ved worked on. All wireframes, HTML, CSS, and JS (aside from any libraries used) are done by me.

## [Account Settings](/accountSettings)
A re-imagination of the existing account settings page on http://smugmug.com. A PDF of wireframes for the new look and a folder of screenshots of existing UI.

## [Chilly Pig Creations](/chillyPigCreations)
A hand-coded proof-of-concept design for http://chillypigcreations.com
